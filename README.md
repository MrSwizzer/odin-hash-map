# 🗺️ Hashmap Project

This project is part of **The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum**, where I implemented a **Hashmap** (also known as a **Hash Table**) to practice working with key-value pairs and understanding how efficient data lookups are achieved using this data structure.

## 🌟 Features

- Implemented a **basic Hashmap** with collision handling using **separate chaining**.
- Created methods to **add**, **remove**, and **search** for elements in the hashmap.
- Handled edge cases like hash collisions and **resizing the table** when the load factor increases.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)**: To implement the hashmap and its collision-handling mechanisms.

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- Understood how **hash functions** work and how they distribute keys across an array.
- Learned how to implement **collision handling** using separate chaining (linked lists within each bucket).
- Explored **efficiency** considerations, such as resizing the hash table and maintaining a good **load factor**.
